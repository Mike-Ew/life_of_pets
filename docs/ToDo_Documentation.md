        *   Generate and return an authentication token (e.g., JWT) upon successful registration.
        *   Implement error handling for duplicate emails or invalid input.
    *   **Database:**
        *   Create a `users` table with fields for `id`, `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

*   **1.1.2. Login with Email/Password:**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Design a login form with email and password fields.
        *   Implement client-side validation.
        *   Integrate with the backend API endpoint for user login.

        *   Create a `/users/:user_id/pets` or `/me/pets` API endpoint (e.g., GET `/api/me/pets`) to retrieve all pets belonging to the authenticated user.
        *   Ensure proper authorization: users can only view their own pets or public profiles of other pets (depending on privacy settings).

### 1.3. Matching Algorithm

**Objective:** Develop a system to connect pets with potential playmates or adopters based on defined criteria.

**Detailed Steps:**

*   **1.3.1. Develop Algorithm to Match Pets with Potential Playmates/Adopters:**
    *   **Backend Logic:**
        *   Define matching criteria:
            *   **Basic:** Proximity (location), species, size, age range.
            *   **Advanced:** Temperament (from user input), energy level, play style.
        *   Implement a matching function that takes a pet's profile and returns a list of potential matches, ordered by relevance.
        *   Consider using a recommendation engine approach (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) if the app scales.
        *   Store matching preferences for each pet (e.g., "looking for playmate," "looking for adoption," "prefers small dogs").
        *   **Initial Algorithm Idea:**
            1.  Filter by species (e.g., dog with dog).
            2.  Filter by location/distance (e.g., within 10 miles).
            3.  Filter by compatible age/size ranges.
            4.  Score remaining pets based on shared interests or temperament tags.
    *   **Database:**
        *   Add fields to `pets` table for `looking_for` (e.g., 'playmate', 'adoption'), `temperament_tags` (e.g., 'energetic', 'calm', 'friendly').
        *   Consider a `preferences` table if matching criteria become complex.

*   **1.3.2. Implement Swipe/Like Functionality:**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Design a "discovery" interface (e.g., card-based UI similar to dating apps) to display potential pet matches one by one.
        *   Implement "swipe left" (dislike/pass) and "swipe right" (like) gestures or buttons.
        *   Integrate with backend API endpoints to record user's interaction (like/dislike).
        *   Display a "It's a Match!" animation/notification when a mutual like occurs.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Create API endpoints (e.g., POST `/api/matches/like`, POST `/api/matches/dislike`).
        *   Record the "like" or "dislike" action in a `swipes` or `likes` table.
        *   When a user "likes" a pet, check if that pet has already "liked" the current user's pet.
        *   If it's a mutual like, create a new entry in a `matches` table and trigger a notification.
    *   **Database:**
        *   Create a `swipes` table with `id`, `swiper_pet_id`, `swiped_pet_id`, `action` ('like'/'dislike'), `created_at`.
        *   Create a `matches` table with `id`, `pet1_id`, `pet2_id`, `match_date`.
