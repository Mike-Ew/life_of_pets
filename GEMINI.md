This is a mobile application for tracking pet care activities. It is built with React Native and Expo. The app allows users to create feeding schedules, record vaccination information, and track other events like vet visits and grooming appointments.

## Building and Running

To run the application, you can use the following commands:

*   `npm start`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run android`: Runs the app on an Android emulator or connected device.
*   `npm run ios`: Runs the app on an iOS simulator or connected device.
*   `npm run web`: Runs the app in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

The codebase follows the standard React Native and Expo conventions. The main application component is in `App.js`, and the entry point is `index.js`. The UI is styled using inline styles with `StyleSheet.create`.
